README

	This app is a time clock designed for workplaces. Includes functionality for recording employee clock in/ clock out times, requesting time off, user sign ups, user search, and employee scheduling.

	When the user first enters the site, they are introduced to the login screen. If they put in their username and password, and click on the log in button, they will proceed to the homepage.

	If the user clicks on the sign up button, they proceed to the sign up page, and they are to fill in their first name, last name, email, and password. Once they click on the sign up button, their  information will be saved to Parse Back4app. 

	Once the user is in the homepage, they will see a navigation bar that contains buttons such as Home,request time off, Schedules, list, sign out, and search. Additionally, three buttons in the middle are displayed which allows the user to clock in, clock out, or have a meal break. The home button navigation bar directs them to this homepage.

	When the user clicks on schedules, they will see a bulletin like schedule when they are called in to work.

	On the list.html page, employee list is displayed of all who works in the organization.

	they are given input fields of when they want to request time off from the start date to end date, and listing a reason of why they're taking time off. Once they click on "Save Custom Event", it will be saved and it will be displayed on the calendar. On the search.html page, there is an input field which allows you to search for a user in the organization by their username. once entered correctly, it will provide their username, first name, last name, and date hired.
